00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Building a cloud-native application can often be difficult.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.500
Setting up the right environments

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Using suitable libraries. And figuring out

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.500
an easy way to deploy and debug your application is time consuming

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.466
To help you solve these challenges, we built Nocalhost

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.466
Nocalhost is an cloud-native development tool based on IDEs

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:26.966
It optimizes connect, deploy, develop and debug process

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.966
That makes cloud-native development easier and faster

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.933
Nocalhost supports a number of IDEs

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.933
Including Visual Studio Code and JetBrains

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:39.233
This way, you can leverage the tools you already know

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.400
Let's dive deeper into how Nocalhost

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.800
optimizes connect, deploy, develop and debug

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.533
First, connect

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.533
Nocalhost helps you connect to Kubernetes cluster easily by

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.933
 using KubeConfig, and it also supports multi-cluster connections

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.533
Nocalhost works with any Kubernetes cluster

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.533
Whether it is local Docker Desktop or Minikube

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.900
Or any cloud-based clusters

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.400
Nocalhost can connect by one click

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.000
It helps you to get rid of the pesky local environment configurations

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's see how to deploy applications

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Nocalhost provides an easy way to deploy application to any namespace

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Nocahost supports  to deploy application  through Manifest Yaml、

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.200
Helm and Kustomize

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.200
Can quickly deploy the application to Kubernetes cluster

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.500
After deployed

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
you can start to develop

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.333
Nocalhost supports to develop standard types of workloads

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Select the corresponding workload and click [Hammer] icon

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Nocalhost will start the DevMode

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.500
Let's see how DevMode works

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.500
Once enter DevMode,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Nocalhost will replace the remote container image with DevImage

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Use the DevImage to start a new POD and replace the exiting POD

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Turn on port-forward in remote POD

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500
So you can now easily access remote application in local

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.000
Start real-time file synchronization

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.500
 Sync the local file to remote POD automatically

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.000
automatically start terminal in remote POD

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This way, you can compile, run remotely through the IDE

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When developing, Nocalhost can automatically synchronize the code

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to container evetime you make a change

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.400
Developer can easily to use code startup process in DevContainer

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.400
Nocalhost eliminate the submit, building and pushing cycles

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400
This can significantly speed up the feedback loop of development

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400
So you see updates in under a second

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.200
You may discover issues in your application

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.200
Nocalhost is here to help by providing the same debugging experience

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.000
 you're used in the IDE even when

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.800
debugging in remote Kubernetes cluster

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800
If you need to dive deeper

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.133
Nocalhost also comes with a built-in log viewer

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:43.566
To helps you

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:47.000
to monitor and debug issues with your Kubernetes right within your IDE

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.566
Now you know how Nocalhost works

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:51.566
to improve your experience creating

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.566
cloud-native application within your favorite IDE

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:57.566
by optimize the connect, deploy, develop and debug process

00:02:57.566 --> 00:03:00.366
We hope this short introduction to Nocalhost gives

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:02.366
 you all need to get started

00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:05.366
Nocalhost is the most productive way to build cloud-native applications.

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:08.366
